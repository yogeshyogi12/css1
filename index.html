<h1 class="color-red">  <i> css can be added to HTML documents in  3 ways:  </i></h1>



<ul class="letter"> 
    <li>
    Inline - by using the the style attribute inside HTML elements1 </li>
    <br>

    <li> Internal - by using a style element in the head section  </li>
    <br>
    <li> External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <br> 
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However <span style="background-color: yellow;"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal stylish, </span> this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

</ul>


<p>
When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is the CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
</p>


<p>
There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
